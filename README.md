From Google Play product discription:
"When you quit playing Monopoly early, chances are you are tired. When you are tired it is hard to add up the values of your properties and cash. When it is hard to do math you get frustrated. When you use Monopoly Calculator you don't have to add up anything. That means no frustration and no broken furniture. In Monopoly Calculator enter player names, cash values, and what properties players own (with or without houses and hotels). Next, press calculate and see if you are a Monopoly champ or if your friends have more money than you. BONUS: A copy of the official Monopoly rules taken from the Monopoly rule book is in the app. So when you and your friends don't agree on how much money you start with you can just look it up right in the same app where you can calculate how much money they end with. Monopoly Calculator is ad-free."
